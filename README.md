# PythonCodeSnippets
Random python tasks that I needed in various scripts and first wrote as standalone scripts as a learning experience. I will try to list the diffrent scripts in this file with a short description, though most file names are self explaining. I use this collection to lookup individual functionalities in case I need them for more elaborate Python Projects.

- del_files_in_dir.py --> delete all files in a specific directory
- get_week_of_year.py --> play with dates to get the week of the year value
- list_dir_in_terminal.py --> list the contents of a directory in the terminal
- required_packages.py --> check if a list of python packages is installed. If the package is not, install it.
- simple_progressbar.py --> terminal prograss bar for a longer loop with no output
- test_arguments.py --> handle arguments passed along with the python call 
- zip_it_up.py --> create a zip file of a specific directory

Enjoy...

# PythonCodeSnippets
Random python tasks that I had to implement and first wrote as standalone scripts as a learning experience. I will try to list the diffrent scripts in this file with a short description. I use this, so I am always able to lookup individual functionalities in case I need them for a more elaborate Python Project.

Enjoy...
